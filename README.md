# poker-ai-decision-engine
This is an ongoing project which implements a poker game environment from basic data strcutures. I am now working on setting up the infrastructure to 
have the poker-ai-decision-engine play against itself and utilize deep reinforcement learning and counterfactual regret minimization to achieve
an unbeatable level of performance. Also working on setting up a python based game environment in order to make use of the better ML libraries
available for my engine.

# Roadmap
1. Advanced Classifier: Implementing the full bot to classify opponent playstyles.
2. Reinforcement Learning: Integrating RL models for sequential decision optimization under uncertainty.
3. Nash Equilibrium: Refining the decision engine to approximate GTO play.
