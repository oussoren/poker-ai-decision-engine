# poker-ai-decision-engine
This is an ongoing project which implements a poker game environment from basic data strcutures. I am now working on setting up the infrastructure to 
have the poker-ai-decision-engine play against itself and utilize deep reinforcement learning and counterfactual regret minimization to achieve
an unbeatable level of performance. Also working on setting up a python based game environment in order to make use of the better ML libraries
available for my engine.
